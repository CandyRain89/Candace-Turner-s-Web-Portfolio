          <p>Welcome to my coding sanctuary! I’m Candace, a mother and passionate software engineer dedicated to crafting elegant and efficient solutions. With a strong foundation in programming and a penchant for problem-solving, I find joy in turning ideas into reality through the power of code. From an early age, I was captivated by the endless possibilities that technology offers. As I embarked on my journey as a developer, I quickly realized that it wasn’t just about writing lines of code; it was about transforming the way we live, work, and connect with each other. Throughout my journey of transitioning from a paralegal to a software developer, I have been fueled by an unwavering passion for coding and a hunger for knowledge. While my previous experience in the legal field provided me with valuable skills in attention to detail, critical thinking, and problem-solving, it was my introduction to coding through Correlation One that truly ignited my passion for technology. Since embarking on this new path, I have been on a relentless pursuit of growth and skill development. Every day, I embrace the challenges and opportunities that coding presents, pushing myself to learn new languages, frameworks, and concepts. I am inspired by the transformative power of technology and the ability to create innovative solutions that can positively impact the lives of individuals and businesses. Thank you for visiting my portfolio and joining me on this coding adventure!</p>
